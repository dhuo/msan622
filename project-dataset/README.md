## Discussion ##

I collected my dataset from the open source website [worldbank](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator)

I did some modifications, basally I combined different indicates from the open source website, put in one dataset, the columns  have in my dataset are :
- Country Name,
- Country Code,
- Region,GDP (current US$) in 2012,
- IncomeGroup,GDP growth (annual %)in 2012,
- Life expectancy at birth, total (years) in 2012,
- Population (Total) in 2012
- Population ages 15-64 (% of total) in 2012,
- Unemployment, total (% of total labor force) in 2012,
- Foreign direct investment, net inflows (BoP, current US$) in 2012,
- Death rate, crude (per 1,000 people) in 2012

and the rows are related data for each countries, there are a total of 251 countries in the dataset, I still need to work on clean the dataset a little bit, remove the data with empty values.
