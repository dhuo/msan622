## Dataset##
Data set collected from World bank, my columns are economic indicators along with life expectancy, death rate, young population percentage, I might include other indicators reflect the countries performance make it more diversified.
### packages ###
`ggplot2`
`shiny`
`scales`
`reshape2`

I will use the above packages for sure, but might include other packages when in need.

###Techniques###
- small multiples, I plan to use small multiples on certain indicator, for example, GDP growth rate, and compare over different countries, or I will choose to use heatmap to list more countries. I will use `zoomingg`,`filteringg` .
- Scatter plot Matrix, to categorizing the indicators by region/income level (my categorizing data), shown different colors representing the categorizing values, I will use `filtering`,`sorting`.
- Bar chart,  I tend to used barchart to compare two countries by certain indicator in your choice, so I will use `filtering` and `brushing`.

###Planned Interface###
